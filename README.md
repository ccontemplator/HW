# HW1
use command python3 hw1.py in terminal and it'll show the output
the result will be the same pattern as the sample output

the output will be:
[['C0A880', 1018.2818181818182], ['COF9A0', 'None'], ['C0G640', 1016.5083333333333], ['C0R190', 1011.6041666666666], ['C0X260', 1011.8875]]

# HW2
output voltage: 
  by using two for loops each takes 7/10 and 3/10 of period respectively 
  we'll see a 7:3 triangular wave over there 
 
Three buttons b0,b1,b2 each respectively means increase,decrease,and comfirm the weight which can influence the generated wave frequency .

open a thread to start sampling function which constantly sampling from ain(wave after rc filter) at specific rates.
